# Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Projects
## About
This is a collection of small projects completed during Natural Language Processing courses and beyond. Every notebook has a brief description in the beginning.
## Contents
Here's the list of topics and tools explored: 
- Prompt Engineering and LLM API usage for various tasks (classification, sentiment analysis, language practice, sarcasm detection, web search, code generation) 
- Fake news classifier (also tested on fake news generated by ChatGPT)
- Tranformer models and applications (finetuning, text generation, translation, summarization, QA, sentiment analysis, language modeling) 
- Text classification (ANN, RNN, CNN, Markov models, Bayes classifier)
- Topic modeling (LDA, NMF)
- Poetry generator based on Markov model
- Text representation (embeddings, vectorizers, TF-IDF)
- Linear regression in scikit-learn and Tensorflow
